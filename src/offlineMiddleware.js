 * Custom Redux middleware for providing an offline queue functionality.
 *
 * Every action that should be queued if the device is offline should have:
 * ```
 * meta: {
 *   queueIfOffline: true
 * }
 * ```
 * property set.
 *
 * When the device is online this just passes the action to the next middleware as is.
 *
 * When the device is offline this action will be placed in an offline queue.
 * Those actions are later dispatched again when the device comes online.
 * Note that this action is still dispatched to make the optimistic updates possible.
 * However it wil have `skipSaga: true` property set
 * for the `suspendSaga` wrapper to skip the corresponding saga.
 *
 * Note that this queue is not persisted by itself.
 * One should provide a persistence config by using e.g.
 * `redux-persist` to keep the offline queue persisted.
 *
 * @param {Object} userConfig See: config.js for the configuration options.
